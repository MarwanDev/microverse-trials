        <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify">
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1955</b> - Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San
            Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He
            grew up with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed
            cars as a hobby.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1972</b> - After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs
            attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, for two years. He dropped
            out after one semester to visit India and study eastern religions in
            the summer of 1974.
          </li>
          <br />
          
          <li>
            <b>1988</b> - Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin
            a new computer company called NeXT. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer
            was introduced at a large gala event in San Francisco, aimed at the
            educational market. Initial reactions were generally good. The
            product was very user-friendly, and had a fast processing speed,
            excellent graphics displays, and an outstanding sound system.
            Despite the warm reception, however, the NeXT machine never caught
            on. It was too costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not
            be linked to other computers or run common software.
          </li>
          <br />    
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1996</b> - In a February 1996 Time magazine article, Jobs said,
            "The thing that drives me and my colleagues â€¦ is that you see
            something very compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to
            get it, but you know, sometimes intuitively, it's within your grasp.
            And it's worth putting in years of your life to make it come into
            existence." Jobs has worked hard to translate his ideas into
            exciting and innovative products for businesses and consumers. He
            was instrumental in launching the age of the personal computer.
            Steve Jobs is truly a computer industry visionary. <br />In December
            of 1996 Apple purchased NeXT Software for over $400 million. Jobs
            returned to Apple as a part-time consultant to the chief executive
            officer (CEO). The following year, in a surprising event, Apple
            entered into a partnership with its competitor Microsoft. The two
            companies, according to the New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on
            several sales and technology fronts." Over the next six years Apple
            introduced several new products and marketing strategies.

          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2005</b> - Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first
            iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.
            The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out
            of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it
            "Invention of the Year" for 2007.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2011</b> - Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3
            p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse
            of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine
            tumor,which resulted in respiratory arrest. He had lost
            consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and
            sisters at his side. His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death
            thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables,
            repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister
            Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's
            partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's
            final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost
            consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral
            was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect
            for Jobs's family, were not made public.
